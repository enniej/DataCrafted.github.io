								<p>I am a Data Scientist and Analyst with 4 years of expertise in leveraging data to drive business insights and operational efficiencies across diverse industries, including healthcare, e-commerce, recruitment, finance,cybersecurity and energy. My passion for turning complex data into actionable strategies has led to successful outcomes in projects ranging from machine learning model development to advanced data visualization and predictive analytics. In my career, I have excelled in designing dynamic data dashboards, implementing machine learning algorithms, and developing advanced analytics frameworks. I have crafted customer behavior analysis dashboards using tools like Power BI , which resulted in a 15% increase in customer satisfaction and optimized marketing engagement. Through the use of real-time performance trackers, I improved sales team efficiency by 20%, while predictive models for inventory management led to a 30% reduction in stockouts and a 25% decrease in holding costs. I have also played a critical role in data integration projects, reducing data retrieval times by 40% and improving accuracy by 95%. A high-profile project I undertook focused on leveraging feature engineering and machine learning models to enhance multimodal breast cancer diagnosis. By utilizing histopathological and mammographic imaging data, I built a multi-stage feature engineering pipeline that boosted diagnostic precision to an impressive 91.92% accuracy. This project combined deep learning models with advanced feature extraction techniques, providing valuable insights into improving AI-assisted diagnostic tools for early breast cancer detection.</p>
								<p>My expertise extends to SQL, Python, Power BI, Tableau, Excel, TensorFlow, and DAX, where I have applied statistical analysis, machine learning, and business intelligence techniques to solve critical business problems. Additionally, I have delivered machine learning models for ransomware detection, customer churn analysis, and cohort modeling, which were crucial in improving decision-making processes and operational efficiency. Throughout my career, I have consistently transformed raw data into insightful visualizations, predictive models, and actionable business strategies. My collaborative approach allows me to work seamlessly across data, marketing, and business teams, aligning technical solutions with business goals. With a solid foundation in advanced data analytics and machine learning, I am passionate about solving complex challenges and continuously driving innovation in the ever-evolving world of data science.</p>
